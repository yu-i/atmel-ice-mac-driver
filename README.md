#Atmel ICE Mac Driver (for use with avrdude)
 
If you get the error:
 
avrdude: usbdev_open(): error claiming interface 0: Permission denied
avrdude: usbdev_open(): error claiming interface 1: Permission denied
avrdude: usbdev_open(): error claiming interface 2: Permission denied
avrdude: usbdev_open(): no usable interface found
avrdude: usbdev_open(): did not find any USB device "usb" (0x03eb:0x2111)
avrdude: jtag3_open_common(): Did not find any device matching VID 0x03eb and PID list: 0x2111
 
 
OSX is claiming the USB Device. The trick is to install a dummy kext to prevent that. The method is outlined here:http://www.proxmark.org/forum/vi...
 
you'll have to change the pid and vid to match that of Atmel ICE.
 
For your convenience, I've attached the kext (contains no code, only Info.plist)
 
extract the zip archive and copy it to this location (you might have to type in your password)

/System/Library/Extensions

change permissions and ownership:

`sudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/AtmelICE.kext`


`sudo chmod -R 755 /System/Library/Extensions/AtmelICE.kext`
 
reload the kext cache:

`sudo kextcache -system-caches`

restart your computer
